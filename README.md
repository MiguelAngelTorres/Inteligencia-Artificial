1 and 2 are the "brain" of an agent prepared to discover and save maps of a game called "The Belkan Worlds" given by the UGR.

3 is a mix of files which are some rules of a conversational agent. It is written with AIML and again, it will not work without the
right program. The agent simules a conversational scheduler for manage appointments, saving the place, the our, and the personal details of the people who comes to it.
